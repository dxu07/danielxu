								<p>Teamfight Tactics(TFT) is an strategy based autobattler: a round-based PvP game where 8 different players try to create a team that battles automatically on their behalf. There are
									many small nuances in the game that make it difficult, including managing your economy to buy your team, scouting enemy teams to make sure that you position your team properly,
									and creating optimal items that improve your team's survivability and damage output. But the most interesting, and probably the most important, aspect of the game is to decide 
									which champions you assign to your team to beat your opponents. Traditionally, players would figure out what the best team compositions are by trying out different things while they 
									play. As more games are played, statistics sites would analyze the millions of games being played and showcase the team compositions that had the highest winrates among high ranking 
									players. The best team compositions are called the "meta", and players will generally try to play towards the meta team compositions. 
								</p>
								<p>But TFT has another problem: there are only a limited number of champions available in the pool that every player must buy from. If every player in the game is trying to play the meta, 
									then they will all be trying to buy the same units. Since there is a high demand for the meta champions and a low supply of them, then players who are unable to buy the meta champions
									first will lose. A lot of the strategy in the game once the meta is discovered comes from being able to accumulate enough gold and health to successfully buy all of the champions before 
									your opponents are able to. However, in Set 11, a trait called "Exalted" was introduced. In TFT, a trait is a unique characteristic or classification of a champion that provides certain 
									bonuses or effects when a specific number of champions with the same trait are present in your team. These bonuses can either affect only the champions that have that trait or affect 
									the entire team. The Exalted trait is particularly strong because it provided a powerful damage boost to everyone in the team. This damage boost is strong enough to make non-meta champions
									capable of being able to compete with the more powerful champions. However, the trait is difficult to play because the champions that have the Exalted trait change from game to game, and 
									they may not neccesarily slot into meta team compositions. As a result, players tended to ignore this trait in favor of the meta. 
								</p>
								<p>I wanted to find a way so that I could play the Exalted team compositions every game since it was under utilized but still very powerful. Trying to figure out what your team composition 
									is while you're in game can be challenging since there are many other aspects of the game you have to focus on before you can roll for your team. So in order to help me win more, I decided to create
									a program that does the thinking for me.

								</p>
								<p>Through my implementation of this solution, I was able to overcome a critical issue and enable the ball-balancing system to function, which allowed my team to be one of the few that managed to successfully balance the ball on the tilting platform.</p>
